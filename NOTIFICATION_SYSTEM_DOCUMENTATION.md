## Overview
The notification system has been fully implemented with all switches working and integrated with Firestore and the app. The system supports both push notifications and email notifications to all authorized users.

## Features Implemented

  - When enabled, you can set a custom low stock threshold
  - Notifications sent when inventory falls below this threshold
  
- **Sales Alerts**: Toggle on/off
  - Notifications sent when new sales are completed
  
- **Login Alerts**: Toggle on/off
  - Notifications sent when new login attempts are detected

### 2. Notification Channels

#### Push Notifications
- **Toggle**: Enable/disable browser push notifications
- **Permission Request**: Automatically requests browser permission when enabled

- **Test Function**: "Send Test Notification" button sends test push notification

#### Email Notifications
- **Toggle**: Enable/disable email notifications

### 3. Automated Reports
Toggle switches for scheduled report delivery:

- **Weekly Summary**: End of week report  
- **Monthly Summary**: End of month report

All report preferences are saved to Firestore and can trigger email notifications.

### 4. Send Test Notification Feature

   - Sends test email to all authorized emails from Security tab
   - Shows success message with recipient count
4. Displays detailed results showing:

   - Success/failure status for each
   - List of email recipients

**Test Results Display:**

### 5. Integration with Security Tab

**Authorized Emails:**
- Email notifications are sent to ALL emails listed in the Security tab

- When you click "Send Test Notification", it retrieves the current authorized emails
- No need to manually configure recipients - it's automatic!

**How it works:**
1. Go to Security tab and add authorized emails
2. Go to Notifications tab and enable Email Notifications
3. Click "Send Test Notification" to send to all authorized emails
4. System automatically retrieves and sends to all authorized users

### 6. Firestore Integration

All notification settings are saved to Firestore in real-time:

**Notification Fields:**
```javascript
{
  notifications: {
    lowStockAlerts: boolean,

- `src/services/security.js` - User authorization

### Key Functions:

**handleNotificationChange(type, value)**

## Firebase Cloud Functions Required

For email notifications to work in production, you need to deploy a Firebase Cloud Function:

```javascript
// functions/index.js
const functions = require('firebase-functions');
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

exports.sendEmailNotification = functions.https.onCall(async (data, context) => {
  // Email sending logic here
  // Use your email service (SendGrid, Gmail, etc.)
});
```

## Best Practices

- Try different browser (some browsers block notifications by default)

**Email notifications not sending:**
- Verify authorized emails are added in Security tab
- Check Firebase Cloud Functions are deployed
- Review Firebase Functions logs for errors
- Ensure email service is configured correctly

**Settings not saving:**
- Check Firestore connection
- Verify user has write permissions
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure settings document exists in Firestore

2. Review Firestore rules for proper permissions
3. Verify Firebase configuration
4. Test with different browsers/devices
5. Check email service configuration
